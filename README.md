# CIS-Sentinel-Automated-Auditing-for-Windows-Linux-Systems
The focus of this project is to develop an automated audit script tailored for Windows 11 (Enterprise and Standalone) and Linux operating systems (Red Hat Enterprise and Ubuntu) based on CIS benchmarks. By automating the audit process, organizations can ensure that their systems adhere to CIS security guidelines in an efficient and reliable manner.

# CIS Sentinel: Automated Auditing for Windows & Linux Systems

## Overview
CIS Sentinel is an automated auditing tool designed for Windows 11 and Linux systems based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks. It helps administrators ensure their systems are compliant with the best security practices by automatically checking configurations and providing detailed reports.

## Features
- Automated Audits: Perform comprehensive audits of both Windows and Linux systems.
- CIS Benchmark Compliance: Ensure systems adhere to the latest CIS benchmarks.
- Detailed Reporting: Generate detailed, easy-to-read reports outlining audit findings and recommendations.
- Cross-Platform: Supports both Windows 11 and major Linux distributions.
- Customizable Audits: Modify audit checks based on organizational needs.
- Real-Time Notifications: Get immediate feedback on system compliance and potential security risks.

## Technologies Used
- Windows PowerShell: For auditing Windows 11 systems.
- Shell Scripting: For auditing Linux systems.
- Python: For cross-platform reporting and automation.
- CIS-CAT Pro Assessor: Integrated for enhanced CIS compliance checks (optional).

## System Requirements
### Windows
- Windows 11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Administrator Privileges

### Linux
- Linux distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora
- Bash 4.0 or later
- Root Privileges

### Additional Tools
- Python 3.x (for cross-platform scripting and reporting)
- CIS-CAT Pro Assessor (optional, for advanced auditing)

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cis-sentinel.git
cd cis-sentinel
\`\`\`

2. Install Dependencies:
- Windows: Ensure you have the latest version of PowerShell installed. The script will automatically verify prerequisites.
- Linux:
\`\`\`
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y bash python3
\`\`\`

3. Configuration: Customize the \`config.yml\` file to modify the audit checks (optional).

4. Run the Audit:
- Windows:
\`\`\`
./audit_windows.ps1
\`\`\`
- Linux:
\`\`\`
sudo ./audit_linux.sh
\`\`\`

## Usage
1. Perform an Audit: Run the script for your respective operating system to start the audit. The results will be saved in the \`/reports\` directory with detailed findings and recommended actions.

2. View Reports: Reports are generated in both text and HTML formats for easier reading.

3. Customization: Edit the \`config.yml\` file to specify which audit checks to run, such as enabling or disabling specific CIS rules.

## Customization Options
- Audit Levels:
  - Level 1: Basic security recommendations.
  - Level 2: Advanced security configurations.
  
- Notification Settings: Enable or disable real-time notifications in the \`config.yml\` file.
  
- Custom Scripts: Add your custom audit scripts in the \`/custom-scripts\` directory and integrate them into the main audit flow.

## Roadmap
- v1.0.0: Initial release with basic audit functionalities.
  
- v2.0.0: Integrating CIS-CAT Pro Assessor for advanced auditing. Multi-language support for audit reports.

- Future Releases: Adding support for macOS. Integration with cloud services for remote auditing.
