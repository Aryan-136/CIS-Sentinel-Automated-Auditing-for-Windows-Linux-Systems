# CIS-Sentinel-Automated-Auditing-for-Windows-Linux-Systems
The focus of this project is to develop an automated audit script tailored for Windows 11 (Enterprise and Standalone) and Linux operating systems (Red Hat Enterprise and Ubuntu) based on CIS benchmarks. By automating the audit process, organizations can ensure that their systems adhere to CIS security guidelines in an efficient and reliable manner.
